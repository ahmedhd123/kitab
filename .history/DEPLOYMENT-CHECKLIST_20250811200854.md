# 2. Build all components
# 3. Build production APK
# 4. Run verification tests
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Development workflow
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-functionality

# Make changes and test
npm run dev
npm run test:all

# Update configurations for testing
npm run config:dev

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new functionality"

# Push to develop
git push origin feature/new-functionality

# Create pull request to master
# After review and approval, merge to master

# Deploy to production
git checkout master
git pull origin master
npm run deploy:complete
```

### Version Management
